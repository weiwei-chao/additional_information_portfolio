      <p>Hello! My name is Wei Wei Chao, or Ya-Wei Chao. Welcome to my website! Welcome to explore more about me, my dance journey, cheerleading journey, and more. I'm currently a senior at Pacific American School at Hsinchu, Taiwan. Throughout these 17 years, there are many ups-and-downs, some were inevitabily forgotten, but some significant events were unforgettable. Dancing was the first dream I discovered, and has remained a huge part of my life. It is my favorite interest as well as profession. Other than dancing, I also have a wide range of interests, including: competitive cheer, acting, coding, MUN debate, ice skating, and more. Some of my favorite comical/romantic movies are Brooklyn 99 and Modern Family. My favorite fictional novel series of all time are Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus. In terms of academic interests, I love math and any other subjects that require me to apply math. I am confident (sometimes people say it's narcissist) outgoing, cooperative, humorous, and (tbh) quite weird. </p>
